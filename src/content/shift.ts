    "Something happened in early 2026. Now the best AI tools are so powerful, they make everyone a builder. Each and every one of your employees can with AI build new workflows, stunning presentations, deep data analysis,... they can super charge their own work efficiency.",
    "But something much more profound than efficiency happens: Employee engagement skyrockets. With the right tools, we see a 'builder mentality' arising. We see employees that had grown apathetic suddenly bursting with energy. Welcome back to high engagement, high passion, and late-nighters out of insatiable builder energy.",
    "Because of this builder energy - we do not believe that AI empowerment will result in cost-cutting exercises. We believe it will result in increased creativity, employee retention, work quality, revenues, and profits. That is why we believe it is 'Time To Build.",
