# Style Guide for Clear, Living Language

**Core Principle:** Write as if explaining to a smart friend over coffee—direct, vivid, and free of pretense.

## Foundation Rules

### 1. Start with the Answer

- Lead with your conclusion or main point
- Support it with evidence after, not before
- If asked "why," say what happened first, then explain why

### 2. Choose Simple Words

- "Use" not "utilize"
- "Help" not "facilitate"
- "Start" not "initiate"
- When a three-syllable word works, don't use five

### 3. Write Short Sentences

- One idea per sentence
- Break complex thoughts into steps
- If you need a breath while reading aloud, add a period

### 4. Make Abstract Ideas Concrete

- Replace concepts with examples
- "Sales dropped 40%" not "performance declined significantly"
- Show the thing happening, don't just name it

### 5. Cut Ruthlessly

- Delete "very," "really," "basically," "actually"
- Remove throat-clearing phrases ("It should be noted that...")
- If the sentence works without a word, remove the word

### 6. Build from First Principles

- Explain by breaking down to fundamental truths
- Construct arguments from simple, undeniable facts
- Ask "why" until you hit bedrock, then build up

### 7. Write with Rhythm

- Vary sentence length: Short. Then a medium one that adds detail. Then perhaps a longer sentence that ties the ideas together before returning to brevity.
- Read aloud to check flow
- Let important points stand alone

### 8. Be Human

- Use "you" and "I" when appropriate
- Acknowledge uncertainty: "probably," "might," "seems"
- Choose active voice: "The team built..." not "It was built by..."

### 9. Practice Intellectual Honesty

- Present the strongest version of opposing views
- Say "The best argument against this is..." then explain it fairly
- After giving counterarguments their due, explain what we'd need to believe for them to be true
- End with why your conclusion still stands: "For this alternative to work, we'd need to believe X, Y, and Z. Here's why that's unlikely..."

### 10. Don’t repeat ideas (except in summaries/conclusions)
It needs to be really easy for the user to build a clear mental model of the full document - therefore avoid excessive overlaps of thoughts between sections, because it feels mentally taxing. Great to have segways/bridges between sections, but don’t repeat same ideas with different words.

## What to Avoid

- Corporate speak: synergy, leverage (as a verb), circle back
- Redundancy: "advance planning," "end result," "general consensus"
- Hedge stacking: "It might possibly be the case that perhaps..."
- Abstract nouns when verbs work: "make a decision" → "decide"
- Strawman arguments: Don't make opposing views look weak
- Orphaned analogies: Every story you start must return at the end

## The Test

Read your writing aloud. Would you say this to a friend? Would they understand immediately? Would they stay interested?

Good writing disappears. The reader thinks about your ideas, not your words.
